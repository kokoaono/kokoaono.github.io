<p>My name is Koko. I was born in Japan and grew up in this beautifil country -Auckland, New Zealand.
Some of my valuses in life are respect, accepting and independence.
I love being active and my mentality is there is nothing to lose by trying! :)
only a wee bit of about me, but thanks for your time! </p>
