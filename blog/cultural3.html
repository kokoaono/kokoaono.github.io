              Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions.<br>
              The ability to understand, interpret and respond to the emotions of others as well as the ability to express and control one’s own emotions.<br>

             The key elements are self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.<br>
