            <li class="has-text-weight-bold">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</li>
            Our brain is like a sponge. It can absorb information and learn new things through repeated activities and practices.<br>
            If you put mind and effort into learning, the neuron in the brain is strengthened which also stimulate other neurons which makes the brain more active and efficient.<br>
            Therefore, learning new things can activate neurons in the brain and increase the capacity of skills and knowledge in people.

            <li class="has-text-weight-bold">How might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</li>
            I will look at new challenges/learning more positive and enjoy the challenge itself.<br>
            Also expect that certain things might be difficult to learn but believe in myself and stay positive even if I struggle to understand at first.

    <div class="block px-6">
        <p>
            <li class="has-text-weight-bold">what is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant?</li>
             Growth mindset is beliefs people have about learning and intelligence and understand the brain grows with efforts also malleable.<br>
             When people understand effort makes them smarter and stronger, they will put time and effort into new challenges.<br>
             This positive belief can increase connectivity between neurons in the brain which eventually change the experience.<br>
             For example, if you believe your brain can grow then your behaviour change which leads to increase in motivation and achievement.

            <li class="has-text-weight-bold">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
            Now I am more aware of how the brain functions, I am more cautious about what I think about learning.<br>
            I do not expect to know the answer or know something straight away because that is a whole point of learning something new.<br>
            Also treat the brain like any other muscles, “if you don’t use it, you lose it”&#128077.

    <div class="block px-6">
        <p>
            <li class="has-text-weight-bold">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
            I will try to believe in myself, be curious, not afraid to make mistakes and learn from mistakes throughout any learning journey.

            I enjoyed this topic. Because it gave me a different perspective of how I can learn new things.<br>
            Challenges are exciting and are opportunities to expand the capacity of the brain.
            I think it is very positive and even if it is hard to comprehend at the begging, we can train our brain just like any other muscles in the body.<br>
            Now, I know how the brain functions I can stay focused and enjoy the challenges and not afraid to make mistakes.
