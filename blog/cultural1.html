<p>Ethical decision</p>
A situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when I picked up a patient from the hospital to the rest home. As my colleague and I arrived at the rest home and took the patient back to the room, we noticed that the bed was not made. Staff told us to transfer the patient onto the bed. My colleague and I looked at each other in shock and told them we are not going to unless the bed is made. After we had same conversation back and forth the staff finally decided to make a bed. I weighed values of equality, fairness and respect in this situation. No matter what situation the patient was in, that is not a reason to treat anyone like the staff did. As a result of us refusing, we were able to get the patient what they deserve as any human beings should do.</p>

<p>How your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
To understand myself better I will give a little background of myself. I was born in Japan. As I was growing up in Japan, respect was a fundamental part of life. This applied not just to people but everything like the way I speak or say things, food, toys to give an idea. The culture also influenced me to be reserved. After moving to New Zealand at young age, the cultural differences influenced how I think which shaped me to be more open and outspoken. Furthermore, the ability to understand two different cultures and the experiences come with it benefited me to be open minded and non jusdgemental.</p>

<p>Strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</p>
My strengths are ability to work well in a team as well as individual. I enjoy working with other people as I see it is an opportunity to learn and always good to interact with others to better myself. Also, ability to organise and work productively in time is something I acquired through a career. This helped me to think ahead, prepared in time and take leadership when needed.
My limitation is over work myself. I have always been a workaholic. I consider this as limitation because it takes up my free time and I forget to take time off day to day basis especially if I am working on my own.</p>

<p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
Working with other people will help me in my learning journey. Talking to someone sometimes gives me different perspectives and thoughts. This could help me approach obstacles and journey differently.</p>

<p>Experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
This experience was when I had to work with 5 other people in a group. The task was to pick a project as group, do research and write a paragraph each. We all started off fine then Covid hit so we had to work remotely. We set up a meeting every week for a couple of hours to see where we are at. After a couple of weeks, I have noticed that one of them was not attending the meeting. I have left him a message see what is happening but there was no reply. In the next meeting I asked the team if they knew anything whom also heard nothing. I suggested the team to leave him a message. Because I was not sure why he was not cooperating and if the person needed help, we were there to help. I also wanted the team to get involved so that it was not just me trying to find out what is happening but as a team. After a few attempts as team, he replied. I think it did work fine even it took us a few attempts because it was the only communication tool we had to reach out at the time. If I am in a similar situation, I would make sure I have more than one communication tools and if this is in work environment, I will talk to manager/leader see if they can find out what is happening. Because whatever reason the person has, he/she might not be comfortable talking to colleagues and I want to respect that personal space.</p>
