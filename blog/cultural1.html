     <li class="has-text-weight-bold">Ethical decision.</li>
         <p>

         A situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when I picked up a patient from the hospital to the rest home. <br>
         As my colleague and I arrived at the rest home and took the patient back to the room, we noticed that the bed was not made. <br>
         Staff told us to transfer the patient onto the bed. My colleague and I looked at each other in shock and told them we are not going to
         unless the bed is made.<br>
         After we had same conversation back and forth the staff finally decided to make a bed.
         I weighed values of equality, fairness and respect in this situation.<br>
         No matter what situation the patient is in,
         that is not a reason to treat anyone like the staff did.<br>
        As a result of us refusing, we were able to get the patient what they deserve as any patients should do.

       <li class="has-text-weight-bold">How your culture has influenced your values and identity.</li>
        <p>
    
        To understand myself better I will give a little background of myself. <br>
        I was born in Japan. As I was growing up in Japan, respect was a fundamental part of life.<br>
        This applied not just to people but everything like the way I speak or say things, food, toys to give an idea. The culture also influenced me to be reserved.<br>
        After moving to New Zealand at young age, the cultural differences influenced how I think which shaped me to be more open and outspoken. <br>
        Furthermore, the ability to understand two different cultures and the experiences benefited me to be more understanding and non judgemental.

     <div class="block px-6">
         
         <li class="has-text-weight-bold">Strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</li>
          <p>
    
         My strengths are ability to work well in a team as well as individual. <br>
         I enjoy working with other people as I see it is an opportunity to learn and always good to interact with others to better myself. <br>
         Also, ability to organise and work productively in time is something I acquired through a career. <br>
         This helped me to think ahead, prepared in time and take leadership when needed. <br>
         My limitation is over work myself.<br>
         I have always been a workaholic. I consider this as limitation because it takes up my free time and I forget to take time off day to day basis especially if I am working on my own.</p>

        <li class="has-text-weight-bold">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</li>
        <p>
    
        Working with other people will help me in my learning journey. <br>
        Talking to someone sometimes gives me different perspectives and thoughts. This could help me approach obstacles and journey differently.

    <div class="block px-6">

        <li class="has-text-weight-bold">Experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.<br>
        Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</li>
     <p>
    
        This experience was when I had to work with 5 other people in a group.
        The task was to pick a project as group, do research and write a paragraph each. <br>
        We all started off fine then Covid hit so we had to work remotely.
        We set up a meeting every week for a couple of hours to see where we are at.<Br>
        After a couple of weeks, I have noticed that one of them was not attending the meeting. 
        I have left him a message see what is happening but there was no reply.
        In the next meeting I asked the team if they knew anything whom also heard nothing.<br>
        I suggested the team to leave him a message. Because I was not sure why he was not cooperating and if the person needed help, we were there to help.
        I also wanted the team to get involved so that it was not just me trying to find out what is happening but as a team.<br>
        After a few attempts as team, he replied.<br>
        I think it did work fine even it took us a few attempts because it was the only communication tool we had to reach out at the time.<br>
        If I am in a similar situation again, I would make sure I have more than one communication tools.
        and if this is in work environment, I will talk to manager/leader see if they can find out what is happening. <br>
        Because whatever reason the person has, he/she might not be comfortable talking to colleagues and I want to respect that personal space.
