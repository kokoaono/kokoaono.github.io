            <li class ="has-text-weight-bold">what are three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning?</li>
            Three new things I have learned about myself as a result of core learning would be not to stress out if I cannt solve a problem or find a solution.<br>
            Take time and figure out what I am not understanding. <br>
            Sometimes I noticed that I lack confidence but told myself to stay focus and donâ€™t beat myself too hard.

        <p>
            <li class = "has-text-weight-bold">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</li>
            The values help to identify where I am at this point and where I want to be in near future(value in life) and how I can achieve the goal.<br>
            Empathy and self-awareness can help understand yourself as well as others and their values.<br>

        <p>
            <li class = "has-text-weight-bold">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
            It made me think about I have never deeply thought about.<br>
            For example, how I brought up, how my culture influenced how I think. There were quite a few deep topics I was really unsure of which surprised me.<br>
        </p>

    <div class = "block px-6">
        <p>
            <li class = "has-text-weight-bold">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
            Making a metal habits.  It is challenging to create a new mental habit and   practice it regularly. <br>
            
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "block px-6">
         <p>
            <li class = "has-text-weight-bold">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</li> 
            Because it can be quite challenging and it does require a lot of attention to focus on a problem.<br>
            This core leaning helps to identify what the problem is and how we going to approach it in daily life.<br>
            Being aware of what is happening around us in the unpredictable environment, paying attention, understand emotions 
            and how we approach it are important skills as a person.

            <li class = "has-text-weight-bold">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</li>
             
            I appreciated it.I think everyone should know what is all about and utilise in their life.<br>
            I enjoyed it and also it was a good break from all coding materials.
