    <ul>
        <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
         <p> 
            My long-term goal will be at where I am able to constantly learn from and teach people around me.
            I believe we can always make ourselves better and learn something new everyday so I definitely want to be in that environment.
        </p>
        <li>Skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>    
        <p>
            Some skills I would like to develop over the course at EDA will be able to speak up what I think and try not to overload myself.</p>
        </p>
        <li>Description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
        <p>
           I respect people’s space and understand we all think/view life differently so me being patient always helped me to understand other people. <br>
           I always have organised approach and able to plan ahead so I can work productively.
           My limitation on the other hand will be, being perfectionist. 
           It upsets me a little bit if things don’t go as planned or things are disorganised.
        </p>
        <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li>
        <p>What works for me in order to work productively will be knowing how much work and time I have to complete the tasks.
         Cmmunicating often with other people to discuss process or any problems.
        </p>
        <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
         <p>Ask peer or look it up</p>
        <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
        <p>My expectations from the facilitation team are fairness, willingness to teach, friendly approach. 
           I think it is fair to say that we all need some help throughout this course and to make 16weeks worth studying
           I would appreciate sharing knowledge as much as they can at appropriate learning journey.</p>
        <li>Any scheduling information </li>
        <p>I have football/soccer training in the evening 2-3 times a week and a game on weekend
         which takes up all day until season is over in...maybe September?</p>
