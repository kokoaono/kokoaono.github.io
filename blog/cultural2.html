                <p> 
                    My long-term goal will be at where I am able to constantly learn from and teach people around me.
                    I believe we can always make ourselves better and learn something new everyday so I definitely want to be in that environment.

                <p>
                    Some skills I would like to develop over the course at EDA will be able to speak up what I think and try not to overload myself.</p>

                    <li class="has-text-weight-bold">Description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
                 <p>

                    I respect people’s space and understand we all think/view life differently so me being patient always helped me to understand other people. <br>
                    I always have organised approach and able to plan ahead so I can work productively.
                    My limitation on the other hand will be, being perfectionist. 
                    It upsets me a little bit if things don’t go as planned or things are disorganised.

                <p>
                    
                    What works for me in order to work productively will be knowing how much work and time I have to complete the tasks.
                    Cmmunicating often with other people to discuss process or any problems.

                <li class="has-text-weight-bold">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
                  <p>

                    My expectations from the facilitation team are fairness, willingness to teach, friendly approach. 
                    I think it is fair to say that we all need some help throughout this course and to make 16weeks worth studying
                    I would appreciate sharing knowledge as much as they can at appropriate learning journey.
