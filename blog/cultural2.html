    <p>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</p>
My long-term goal will be at where I am able to constantly learn from and teach people around me. I believe we can always make ourselves better and learn something new everyday so I definitely want to be in that environment.
<p>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
Some skills I would like to develop over the course at EDA will be able to speak up what I think and try not to overload myself. 
<p>Description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
I respect people’s space and understand we all think/view life differently so me being patient always helped me to understand other people. I always have organised approach and able to plan ahead so I can work productively.
My limitation on the other hand will be, being perfectionist. It upsets me a little bit if things don’t go as planned or things are disorganised.
<p>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p> 
What works for me in order to work productively will be knowing how much work and time I have to complete tasks. Then I can plan how much time I can spend on a task/tasks. Also, communicating often with other people to discuss process or any problems.
<p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>

<p>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
My expectations from the facilitation team are fairness, willingness to teach, friendly approach. I think it is fair to say that we all need some help throughout this course and to make 16weeks worth studying I would appreciate sharing knowledge as much as they can at appropriate learning journey.
<p>Any scheduling information </p>
Friday 14th May 11am until TBC (one off)
