  <h2> Describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
  <div id="block1">
      <p>
        HTML defines structure of a web page. CSS which works along with HTML design web pages.<br>
        HTML is like a builder who builds houses, and CSS is the one to make the house presentable and unique with colours and styles.

        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.
        Control flow is the order in which the instructions in the program are followed. For example, you are at the supermarket with a list.<br>
        On the list there are apple, milk and ice cream.
        You put what you need in the basket and head out to checkout. This is control flow. You follow the list of stuff and move onto next.<br><br>

        On the other hand, the loops in programming is action which is continued/repeated until certain condition is met.<br>
        Loops are when at the supermarket for the purpose of getting ingredients( This is the condition), you are not going to head to checkout or skip an item and walk out of supermarket.<br>
        You will make sure the list is ticked off before proceed to checkout.<br>
        This is the purpose of the loops in programming. Until the list is ticked off next action is withheld

        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        Objects represent “a thing” in the code. Anything made up or defined by a set of characteristics are called properties which consist of a “key” and a “value”.<br>
        Objects can be accessed by using either “dot” or “square bracket” notation.<br>
        Arrays are used to create and store multiple items in a single variable. These are useful as items can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.<br>
        However, first item in an array has an index of “0” then second item as “1” and so on.
        Items can be added and removed from the beginning or end of an array by using “push()”, “pop()”, “unshift()” and “shift()”.

        Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
        Functions group statements together and make code reusable which means that it can be called multiple times from within the program.<br>
        Minimising the errors, save time and reduce amount of code written from scratch and tested.
        Functions also give extensibility when extending a program and allow to modify changes in one place and be effective.
